# parsing_magnit_bot
## The following work is implemented in this bot:
### 1. We collect the number of all shares in this GEO (each city has its own individual code)

### 2. Create a table.csv with data: page - AJAX page, index - card number, card_title, card_old_price, card_new_price, card_discount, card_sale_data

### 3. We send it to the user in a Telegram

Note: the speed of collecting cards is very small 10-300 seconds.
